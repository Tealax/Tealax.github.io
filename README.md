OUR STORY
A Hidden Lunch Gem in Downtown Gallatin

The Sandwich Shoppe is a family-owned lunch spot tucked across from the courthouse on East Main Street. Founded by Tracy Sayles with her daughter Alex and longtime friend Ximena Hernandez, the shop opened in late 2024 and has been winning over the community ever since.
Every sandwich is hand-crafted with six inches of quality meat and made fresh to order. From our signature wraps to hearty classics, every bite is made with love and local pride.
"A hidden lunch gem in the heart of Gallatin — fresh, generous, and made with care."
